    <title>Simple Website</title>

        <h1>This is a simple website.</h1>
        <aside>And it's perfect.</aside>
    </header>
        
        <h2>Seriously, what else do you want?</h2>
        
        <p>You probably build websites and think your work is special. You think your 13 megabyte parallax-ative home page is going to get you some award banner you can glue to the top corner of your site. You think your 40-pound jQuery file and 83 polyfills give IE7 a boost because it finally has box-shadow. Wrong. Let me describe your perfect website:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>It's lightweight and loads fast</li>
            <li>Fits on all your screens</li>
            <li>Looks the same in all your browsers</li>
            <li>It's accessible to every visitor that comes to your site</li>
            <li>It's legible and gets your point across (if you had one instead of just 5mb pics of hipsters drinking coffee)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Well guess what:</h3>
        
        <p>You. Are. Over-designing. Look at this. It's a website. Why do you need to animate a trendy banner flag when I hover over that useless piece of content? You spent hours on it and added 80 kilobytes to your site, and some person jabbing at it on their iPad with fat fingers will never see it. Not to mention blind people will never see it, but they don't see any of your other content either.</p>
        
        <p>You never knew it, but this is your perfect website. Here's why.</p>
        
        <h2>It's lightweight</h2>
        
        <p>This entire page weighs less than the gradient-meshed Facebook logo on your Wordpress site. Did you seriously load 100kb of jQuery UI just so you could animate the background color of a div? You loaded all 7 font faces of a webfont just so you could say "Hi." at 100px height at the beginning of your site? You don't need that.</p>
        
        <h2>It's responsive</h2>
        
        <p>You thought you needed media queries to be responsive, but no. Responsive means that it responds to whatever screen size it's viewed on. This site doesn't care if you're on an iMac or an old mobile device.</p>
        
        <h2>It works</h2>
        
        <p>Look at this. You can read it ... that is, if you can read. It makes sense. It has hierarchy. It's using HTML5 tags so you and your browser know what's in this site. That's semantics.</p>
        
        <p>It has content on the screen. Your site has three bylines and a link to your Dribbble account, but you spread it over 7 full screens and make me click some bobbing button to show me how cool the jQuery ScrollTo plugin is.</p>
        
        <p>Cross-browser compatibility? Load this site in IE6. I dare you.</p>
        
        <h2>This is a website. Look at it. You've never seen one before.</h2>
        
        <p>Like the person who's never grown out their beard has no idea what their true natural state is, you have no idea what a website is. All you have ever seen are skeuomorphic versions of what should be text communicating a message. This is a real, simple website. Look at it. It's beautiful.</p>
        
        <h3>Yes, this is satire</h3>
        
        <p>I'm not actually saying your site should look like this. What I'm saying is that all the problems we have with websites are <strong>ones we create ourselves</strong>. Websites aren't broken by default, they are functional, high-performing, and accessible. You break them.</p>
